## 1. Executive Summary
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed expansion of PCBL (TN) Limited, increasing its carbon black production capacity from 550 to 675 TPD and maintaining a 36 MW waste heat recovery-based captive cogeneration power plant. Situated at Thervoy Kandigai Village, Tiruvallur District, Tamil Nadu, the project occupies 62.46 acres in the SIPCOT Industrial Park and will contribute significantly to the region's industrial output and employment.

The report details India’s and Tamil Nadu’s rising demand for carbon black, especially for use in tyre, rubber, paint, and ink industries. The expansion addresses forecast market growth (CAGR 5.56% globally and 9.2% domestically) and is designed to meet both domestic and export needs. The project includes robust environmental management measures, including advanced air and water pollution controls, waste minimization, energy/resource optimization, and comprehensive risk management frameworks to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Environmental baseline studies within a 10 km radius confirm that the site is industrial, with no eco-sensitive zones nearby. Baseline air, water, noise, soil, biological, and socio-economic parameters have been analyzed and show existing conditions are generally within national standards. Predictive modeling (AERMOD) for air emissions, water and soil assessments, and traffic studies demonstrate that with proposed controls, impacts on air, water, noise, soil, biodiversity, and communities will be minor and reversible.

The EIA details extensive mitigation measures: closed-loop material handling, modern air and effluent treatment plants (meeting ZLD—zero liquid discharge), hazardous and municipal solid waste management (via TSDF and recyclers), extensive greenbelt development, periodic health and safety monitoring, and clear institutional structures for environmental and social management. Public consultation, though exempted for this project, is described, and social benefits (notably employment generation and CER—Corporate Environmental Responsibility—allocations) are quantified and scheduled.

The assessment concludes that the expansion is environmentally sustainable and socio-economically beneficial, provided that environmental management and monitoring plans are fully implemented. The report recommends strict adherence to the EMP, regulatory conditions, and continuous stakeholder engagement.

## 3. Environmental Baseline
### 3.1 Physical Environment
The project area is characterized by tropical climatic conditions, with annual temperatures ranging from 20.9°C to 36.9°C, and an average annual rainfall of 1,391.5 mm, mainly during the northeast monsoon. Relative humidity averages between 69-76%. The site is situated on gently undulating topography at ~62–66 meters above mean sea level (AMSL), with red sandy/clay loam dominant soils, and interspersed black and alluvial soils. The hydrogeology comprises both phreatic and semi-confined aquifers within alluvial and weathered crystalline formations, with groundwater tables typically 2.4–7.4 meters below ground in pre-monsoon and 0.8–5.3 meters in post-monsoon. The drainage is dendritic, with local runoff naturally directed to constructed water harvesting ponds, and no major rivers within 1 km of the project site. The land use pattern within 10 km is primarily agricultural (53.0%), forest (16.6%), and includes industrial, water bodies, and settlements.

### 3.2 Biological Environment
The baseline ecological assessment documents a landscape dominated by cultivated and disturbed areas, with 38 tree species (including Cocos nucifera, Azadirachta indica, Acacia auriculiformis), 21 shrub species, 21 herb species, and 17 climber species. Greenbelts with native species such as teak (Tectona grandis), mahogany, neem, and Terminalia arjuna surround the facility—over 1,300 saplings have been planted. Livestock rearing is common; fauna surveys in the core and buffer zone recorded 5 Schedule-I, 38 Schedule-II, and several Appendix-II/III species (as per the Wildlife Protection Act). No threatened/endangered species occur in the immediate site area; five Schedule-I species (Oriental Honey Buzzard, Black Kite, Shikra, Indian Peafowl, Flapshell Turtle) are in the buffer zone (~9.5 km) and a conservation plan is in place. Aquatic surveys found 20 macrophytes, 21 phytoplankton, 15 zooplankton, and 21 fish species in regional lakes. No eco-sensitive zones or protected habitats are within 10 km of the project.

### 3.3 Socio-Economic Environment
The 10 km study area includes a population of 101,222 (2011 Census), with a near-equal male (49.3%) and female (50.7%) distribution. Major villages are Thervoy Kandigai (population: 3,122), Gummidipoondi, and Uthukkottai. The area is designated as industrial by regional planners and has allied industries nearby. Economic activity is dominated by agriculture, small-scale industries, and employment in industrial estates. Social infrastructure (education, healthcare, roads, and utilities) is well-developed, and the project pledges Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) funds for further improvements. No displacement or resettlement is required; additional employment generation is estimated at 60 permanent and 500 construction workers during expansion.

## 4. Impact Assessment
### 4.1 Air Quality Impacts
Ambient air quality monitoring at eight locations showed baseline levels (PM10: 42.3–64 ug/m3, PM2.5: 18–32 ug/m3, SO2: 5.1–8.4 ug/m3, NOx: 12.2–21.6 ug/m3) within CPCB standards. Modeling (AERMOD) predicts marginal increases due to expansion (incremental PM: 1.78 ug/m3, NOx: 0.42 ug/m3 in worst-case grid), remaining well below NAAQS (PM: 150 ug/m3, NOx/SOx: 600 ug/m3). Stack emissions from 27 sources (including 90m and 60m stacks for boilers/dryers) are strictly controlled by bag filters, venturi scrubbers, and routine LDAR, ensuring process PM, SO2, and NOx concentrations ≤150, 100, and 100 mg/Nm3, respectively. All sources are monitored online. Fugitive emissions are minimized by enclosed handling and stringent operational SOPs. Dispersion modeling confirms negligible offsite health or ecological risk; cumulative impact remains within safe thresholds.

### 4.2 Water Resource Impacts
The project’s total water requirement post-expansion is 3953 KLD, supplied by SIPCOT, with 683 KLD industrial wastewater recirculated (ZLD achieved via ultra-filtration, RO, and MEE). Sanitary wastewater (~42 KLD) is treated in a 50 KLD membrane bioreactor STP and used for greenbelt irrigation. Effluent treatment achieves BOD <5 mg/L, TSS <30 mg/L, and pH 6.5–7.5, meeting TNPCB norms. No direct discharge occurs; surface/groundwater monitoring shows all parameters within IS10500 standards. Rainwater harvesting increases site runoff (storage pond capacity 4,200 m3) and supports groundwater recharge. No adverse impacts on groundwater or surface waters are anticipated.

### 4.3 Noise and Vibration Impacts
Baseline ambient noise is within standards: industrial zone (day: 49.3 dB(A), night: 42.9 dB(A)), residential (day: 48.2–54.5 dB(A), night: 43.5–45 dB(A)). Noise modeling predicts a maximum of 59.6 dB(A) at 1.5km from the plant under worst-case operational load, mainly from compressors, fans, and vehicular movement. All new equipment will comply with applicable noise limits, and mitigation includes acoustic enclosures, greenbelt buffers, and PPE for workers. High-noise areas are tagged; operational measures include equipment rotation and restricted hours. No significant vibration impacts are expected.

### 4.4 Land Use and Soil Impacts
Baseline soil samples indicate neutral to slightly alkaline pH (7.56–7.98), with all nutrients and heavy metal concentrations within CPCB norms. No contamination or loss of fertility is reported. Land use within the site is industrial; 33% of the plot is reserved for greenbelt. During expansion, risks of soil erosion, compaction, or minor contamination are minimized through site paving, controlled storage, prompt cleanup of spills, and greenbelt development. Solid and hazardous wastes are managed per TSDF/SWM Rules. Construction-stage impacts (dust, compaction) are temporary and reversible.

### 4.5 Biodiversity Impacts
No ecologically sensitive areas, protected forests, or critical habitats are present within 10 km of the site. No endangered/threatened species are recorded on site. Five Schedule-I species occur in the buffer (~9.5 km); a conservation plan has been prepared to address their protection. Expansion will not cause significant habitat loss or fragmentation. Greenbelt and landscaping will increase native vegetation. Potential risks to fauna (vehicular traffic, light/noise, waste) are mitigated by strict site controls and spill SOPs.

### 4.6 Socio-Economic Impacts
The expansion will generate direct employment for 60 individuals and construction jobs for up to 500, with further indirect benefits for allied businesses and local service providers. No displacement is required. Community consultation and disclosure are ongoing (public hearing exempted for this project). Corporate Environmental Responsibility funding (Rs 2.7 crore additional, total Rs 6.15 crore) will be directed to educational, health, and infrastructure improvements in local villages over three years. No significant negative social impacts have been identified; the overall effect is positive.

## 5. Mitigation Measures
### 5.1 Environmental Mitigation
Key mitigation measures include: (1) closed-loop transfer and handling of raw materials, (2) installation of advanced bag filters and venturi scrubbers with continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) on all major stacks, (3) implementation of ZLD (zero liquid discharge) for industrial effluents using RO and MEE, (4) reuse of treated water for greenbelt and non-potable use, (5) management of all hazardous/solid waste via authorized TSDF and recyclers, (6) site paving and dedicated stormwater drainage to prevent erosion, (7) routine environmental monitoring of air, water, noise, and soil, and (8) continual improvement via regular audits and EMP review. Greenbelt covering 33% of the site helps attenuate dust, noise, and microclimate impacts.

### 5.2 Social Mitigation
Social mitigation includes ongoing worker health checks, provision of quality PPE, periodic safety training, establishment of sanitary and rest facilities, and annual health status reporting. Community benefits involve execution of CER projects—funded and time-bound—to deliver social infrastructure (schools, health centers, clean water). No relocation or R&R is needed; all hiring prioritizes local labor.

## 6. Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
### 6.1 Monitoring Framework
The environmental monitoring program includes continuous online monitoring for all stack emissions (CEMS), quarterly ambient air, sedimented dust, and noise monitoring at prescribed locations, and online/quarterly tracking of treated effluent quality (BOD, COD, TSS, pH). Groundwater and surface water quality are monitored biannually, while soil testing is annual. The Environmental Management Cell (EMC) oversees record-keeping, compliance reporting, non-compliance response, and corrective action. Data are reported to regulatory authorities and reviewed internally at set intervals. Mock drills for emergency response are scheduled annually.

### 6.2 Implementation Schedule
The EMP and mitigation measures are scheduled to commence immediately upon receiving Environmental Clearance (EC). Construction and installation of new lines are phased over 18 months, with progressive implementation of environmental controls. Monitoring, audits, and reporting are ongoing throughout construction and thereafter. CER/social projects are scheduled for delivery over the first three years and tracked annually.

### 6.3 Budget Allocation
The total project cost for expansion is estimated at Rs. 360 crore. Of this, approximately Rs. 151.37 crore is allocated for pollution control measures (including APC, ETP, RO, greenbelt). An additional Rs. 6.15 crore plus Rs. 2.7 crore (total Rs. 8.85 crore) is earmarked for Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) to support community welfare projects. EMP implementation costs are embedded across plant operations and dedicated EMC staffing.

---

## 7. Public Consultation
Public consultation was not mandated for the project due to the regulatory exemption granted by MoEF&CC (as the site is located within an approved industrial estate and no eco-sensitive zones are nearby). However, the EIA describes outreach efforts in neighboring villages regarding expansion benefits, safety measures, and local employment opportunities. Stakeholder feedback is incorporated into social mitigation and CER planning. The CER budget and activities are consulted with village panchayats and local leaders to ensure alignment with community priorities.

---

## 8. Risk Assessment
### 8.1 Identified Risks
Identified risks include: storage and handling of flammable raw materials (CBFS, HSD), process leakages, fire/explosion hazards in reactors and storage areas, and occupational exposure to dust or noise. Risk modeling (MCA, consequence analysis) shows low levels (individual risk <1E-09/year), with impacts largely confined onsite. Worst-case scenarios were assessed; no significant offsite population risk or catastrophic failure predicted. Natural hazards (flood, earthquake) are minimal based on local history and site elevation.

### 8.2 Emergency Response Plan
A comprehensive onsite Emergency Response and Disaster Management Plan (DMP) is in place, including fire detection and suppression systems (hydrants, extinguishers), PA systems, mock drills, and trained response teams. Emergency communication protocols connect with local authorities. Offsite DMP addresses rare scenarios affecting external areas and provides for community notification and mutual aid from government agencies. Evacuation, medical support, and containment procedures are periodically rehearsed as per ToR requirements.

---

## 9. Regulatory Compliance
The expansion holds all necessary statutory approvals, including EC from MoEF&CC, ToR, and valid CTE/CTO from TNPCB, as well as hazardous waste authorization. Additional clearances (PESO, fire, boiler, land/water allotment) are in place. The EMP is designed to meet EIA Notification 2006 and all subsequent regulatory amendments. Routine compliance reporting and environmental audits are mandated. No pending litigation or environmental cases exist for the project as of the report date.
