- **Land**: no land conversion (NA land); construction waste managed and recyclables recovered.
- **Ecology**: no ecologically sensitive areas affected; site stated to have no trees; greenbelt planned.
- **Socio-economic**: ~100 workers; prefer local hiring; traffic regulation and non-peak material movement.

### 9.2 Operation phase
- **Water**: demand **396 KLD**; negative pressure due to consumption mitigated by reuse and RWH recharge.
- **Water quality**: no wastewater discharge to ground water; treated sewage reused.
- **Air**: DG emissions (SO2/NOx/HC) controlled; **stack height = building height + 3.5 m**; low-sulphur HSD and maintenance.
- **Noise**: mitigated by equipment selection, acoustic enclosures for DGs, maintenance, landscaping/greenbelt.
- **Traffic**: medium negative impact anticipated; mitigations include controlled movement during peak hours, bus services, and carpooling encouragement.
- **Employment**: report indicates ~**50 direct** jobs in operation.

## 10) Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
### 10.1 EMP structure and governance
- EMP elements: **Commitment & Policy**, **Planning**, **Implementation**, **Measurement & Evaluation**.
- Suggests forming a **Monitoring Team** (site in-charge + planning representative + implementation representative) for compliance and EMP operation.

### 10.2 Air environment
- **Construction**: dust control plan (watering protocols for earthmoving and disturbed areas; unpaved road watering/speed limit; open pile watering; truck tyre wash/downwash at exit; covering loads during transport).
- **Operation**: main source is DG sets; NOx reduction via inherent low-NOx/temperature retarder and higher stack/dilution (add-on technologies not preferred due to “pollution transfer”); **greenbelt** as sink for pollutants.

### 10.3 Noise environment
- **Construction**: noise shields (~3 m physical barriers), no night-time noisy operations, job rotation and hearing protection.
- **Operation**: DG sets to have **acoustic enclosures** meeting **CPCB** requirement (**75 dB(A) at 1 m at 75% load**); walls/ceilings lined with glass wool; design to achieve ~**25 dB(A)** insertion loss.

### 10.4 Water environment
- **Construction**: prevent runoff pollution; septic tank connection for wastewater; spill control for oil/grease; impervious floors/drains, oil-water separators/clarifiers; garland drains with baffles; avoid excavation in monsoon.
- **Operation**: water conservation, reuse and recycling; sewage treated in **385 KLD** STP; treated water reused for flushing/gardening and greenbelt.

### 10.5 Land/solid waste
- Construction debris recycled (aggregate for fillers/sub-base roads); gypsum/plaster-rich debris not used as fill; recyclables sold; hazardous/toxic substances stored in sealed, labeled containers and disposed per Hazardous & Other Wastes Rules, 2016.
- Operation phase emphasizes **4Rs** and Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016; segregation and OWC composting; STP sludge and garden waste composting; recyclables to recyclers.

### 10.6 Biological environment / greenbelt
