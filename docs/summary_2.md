## 6. Analysis of alternatives

- Three options assessed; **Option 1 selected** because:
  - lower forest diversion,
  - no sensitive features within required RoW,
  - least settlement impacts.

---

## 7. Impact assessment (key issues)

### 7.1 Construction phase

- **Air:** dust emissions from clearing, excavation, hauling, plants; higher PM during works.
- **Noise/vibration:** equipment, DG sets, transport; need scheduling and barriers/PPE.
- **Water:** risk from runoff/siltation and fuel/oil/paint spills near drains/ponds; mitigated via silt fencing and oil interceptors.
- **Soil/land:** erosion at slopes/spoil; contamination risk from oils/bitumen and wastes.
- **Ecology:** tree felling and temporary habitat fragmentation; elephant movement risk.
- **Social:** land acquisition, property impacts, perceived lack of transparency in valuation/surveys.

### 7.2 Operation phase

- **Air:** traffic emissions, potential increase in CO (stated to remain within standards).
- **Noise:** higher traffic volumes; horn use near sensitive receptors.
- **Drainage/water:** need functional drains/culverts; manage accidental spills.
- **Safety:** road safety systems (signage, barriers, traffic control plans) emphasized.

---

## 8. Stakeholder consultation & public hearing (what was raised)

Public hearings were recorded for at least **Dharamjaigarh, Pathalgaon and Korba** (tables of verbal/written issues).

**Recurring concerns raised by participants:**

- **Land acquisition & compensation:** adequacy of compensation for agricultural land (especially irrigated/double crop), market-rate comparisons, and the ability to buy replacement land.
- **Tree valuation disputes:** mango/mahua/teak and other tree compensation often described as too low; demands to value fruit trees by **annual income**.
- **Survey/map errors:** missing khasra numbers, incorrect land categories (barren vs fertile), missing trees, demarcation conducted without landowners.
- **Process/consent:** allegations that awards were passed before hearings; requests for Gram Sabha/village-level hearings; Fifth Schedule/scheduled area concerns in Jashpur.
- **Biodiversity/forest impacts:** opposition based on tree cutting and perceived threats to Jashpur “green belt”; repeated demand to upgrade/widen **existing NH** instead of new corridor.
- **Wildlife (elephants):** strong concerns about elephant movement and mortality; project response notes **elephant passes** and a wildlife plan.
- **Construction nuisance:** dust management, noise, and general work-zone safety.

**Typical responses recorded:** compensation per **LARR 2013** and **NH Act 1956**; tree valuation by Forest/Horticulture departments; map corrections by Revenue authorities; public notice via newspapers/GP intimation; and implementation of mitigation measures (compensatory afforestation, traffic control, etc.).
